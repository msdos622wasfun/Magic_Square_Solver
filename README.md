# Magic_Square_Solver
 A small Fortran program that solves 3 x 3 magic squares.

This is my first Fortran program.  Why bother, right?

Well, as I understand it, Fortran is still widely used in the scientific and engineering communities where number-crunching is needed.

Anyway, if you don't know what a magic square is, it's a grid whose numbers all add up to the same value in every direction.

I don't know the actual formula or technique for solving them, so all the program does is plug random numbers in every location until it finds a solution.

In fact, I tried this program with 4 x 4 squares instead, and it looked like the computer was going to sit there for weeks, so 3 x 3 is going to have to be the limit.

Anyway, there are a couple of options you can set, and if you want you can run this program on multiple machines and observe the differences in speed.

(Code::Blocks was used as the IDE.)
